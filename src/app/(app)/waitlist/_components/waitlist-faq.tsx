    question: "How is this different from other Next.js starters?",
    answer:
      "Most starters give you a basic setup and call it a day. We've built production apps with this stack and fixed all the edge cases. Auth that handles email verification, payments with working webhooks, database migrations that don't break. It's the difference between a demo and something you can ship to customers.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I remove features I don't need?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Everything is modular and documented. Don't need payments? Delete the Stripe folder. Don't want the CMS? Remove Payload. Each feature is self-contained with clear removal instructions.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much time will this save me?",
    answer:
      "Beta testers report 2-4 weeks saved on average. Authentication alone usually takes a week if done right. Add payments, email templates, database setup, deployment configs... One founder launched their MVP in 4 days instead of 2 months.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the early access pricing?",
    answer:
      "50% off the regular price for early access members, locked in forever. Think 'reasonable for an indie developer, cheap for a team.' Way less than you'd pay a contractor to build this from scratch.",
  },
  {
    question: "When will this be available?",
    answer:
      "March 2025. We're making sure everything works in production rather than rushing to meet a deadline. Better to launch right than launch fast.",
